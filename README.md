# WsRTMP

`WsRTMP` is a Go-library for proxying livestream data from websocket to external RTMP endpoint.
The code is based from [chuabingquan](https://github.com/chuabingquan)'s work: [pxy](https://github.com/chuabingquan/pxy).
The main intent of this library is to provide portability for those who have the same project (able to stream through websockets) in mind.
